`vnc-domains` is the repository responsible for managing the domains of the APIs of the [Você na Câmara (VNC)](#você-na-câmara-vnc)
platform. In this repository you'll find the source code for the software domains, so it's just an auxiliary repository
for the [`vnc-summarizer`](https://github.com/devlucassantos/vnc-summarizer) and
[`vnc-api`](https://github.com/devlucassantos/vnc-api) software.

## Você na Câmara (VNC)

Você na Câmara (VNC) is a news platform that seeks to simplify the propositions under debate in the Chamber of Deputies
of Brazil aiming to synthesize the ideas of these propositions through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) so that
these documents can have their ideas expressed in a simple and objective way for the general population.
